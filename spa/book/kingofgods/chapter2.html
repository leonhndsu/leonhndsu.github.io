        <p>Not knowing how much time had passed, Zhao Feng started to regain consciousness, but he was not able to feel his body. The only thing he felt was the pain coming from his left eye.

            Left eye?

            Zhao Feng turned cold, and suddenly remembered what happened. Before he fainted, the weird eyeball-shaped marble had stabbed straight into his left eye.

            If it was just a minor injury, his left eye had probably been blinded and could probably be compared with those ugly and berserk ‘one-eyed dragons’.

            When he thought of that, Zhao Feng had the urge to cry.

            Peh! Peh! Peh! Peh!…

            There was a sound like a heartbeat, giving off a familiar and kind feeling, resonating out from his punctured left eye.

            Shoosh!

            He thought about his left eye and in that moment, his consciousness was sucked into the dark marble.

            Boom!

            His brain suddenly shook and Zhao Feng’s mind was brought into a pitch black dimension.

            “This place is...”

            Zhao Feng had a natural fear of the unknown, and seeing such a weird place was completely outside of his experience. But his attention was attracted by the faint green light given off from the center of the pitch black place.

            That faint green light seemed very mysterious, and infinitely deep. It slowly spun, as if it had survived from the ancient times until now, giving people a feeling of life and eternity.

            Zhao Feng’s awareness was fully absorbed by it, and was so absorbed that he would not awaken, not until the sky turned old or the dimension was destroyed.

            “The Ancient is broken, and the Ancient Gods slain will turn into endless dust…”

            The sigh that came with the words seemed so ancient and sad. It reverberated within the pitch black area, as if it also came from the ancient times.

            “Who’s there!?” Zhao Feng consciousness swayed, and his whole body turned cold. He surveyed the area, but could not see anyone.

            That sound seemed to come from the space itself.

            “There is a soul in the universe that is perfectly in sync with me? Is this destiny?” the mysterious voice said to itself.

            “Who’s there sneaking around?!” Zhao Feng suppressed his fear and shouted.

            “To continue my bloodline of the Eye, you will rule everyone, control every race. You lucky youngster, do not disappoint me…”</p>

        <p>The pitch black area suddenly poured out an Ancient consciousness, which then faded away.

            Everything became calm…

            Hah!

            Zhao Feng took a long breath, but before he could think any more, a painful feeling came from his left eye.

            ****************************************************

            Within a room...

            The burning sun came through the window.At this time, Zhao Feng suddenly woke into reality.

            This was his room.

            “Ahhhhh… my eye!” Zhao Feng screamed and clutched his left eye, which was now swollen red and burning with pain.

            Zhao Feng laid back on the bed, and his body still had charred pieces from where he was struck by lightning. The pain coming from his left eye made him sweat and toss around in the room.

            Fortunately, the pain faded away as time went by .

            “My eye…” Zhao Feng had a face full of worry, and slowly loosened the grip around his left eye.

            He was certain that his left eye could still see light.

            When his left eye saw the first ray of sunlight, the strong burn made him squint and let out his breath.

            His left eye eventually adapted to the sunlight and could finally make out the world. However, what came after made Zhao Feng go into shock.

            The whole world seemed to have become tens of thousands of different colors.

            The vision of his left eye made everything seem perfectly clear and beautiful. Zhao Feng could even see the particles in the air, which certainly wasn’t what normal vision could make out.

            He could clearly see ants on a tree 100 meters away, and the veins on a leaf.

            What is going on? My left eye can even…

            Zhao Feng thought about it after the shock passed, and revealed some happiness on his face.

            He was certain that his left eye had undergone a series of changes and was at least ten times stronger than his original eye.

            Zhao Feng took out a mirror and looked at it closely. His left eye’s size was the same as before. The only difference was that the center of the eye was darker than the original. When he fully used his left eye, the eyeball would give off a faint glow of green light.

            These changes, although not very obvious, caused his heart to race.

            “Did…did that mysterious eye merge with my left eye?” Zhao Feng’s heart was happy, but also worried at the same time.

            After a while he took a deep breath, and walked out his room.

            “Feng’er, you did not wake up for one day and one night, do not make me feel so worried!” Zhao Shi saw that her son was alright and was extremely relieved.

            “Mother, I am all right! I might even have gotten lucky from this disaster,” Zhao Feng laughed. However, his face soon turned solemn. “Wait! Mother, did you say…that I was unconscious for one day and one night?”</p>

        <p>“Yes, that day after you were hit by lightning, but the alchemist said that you were just unconscious.” Zhao Shi wiped her eyes, scared by what might have happened.

            While they talked, Zhao Feng’s stomach growled, and only then did he feel the hunger rise up inside him.

            “Come! I will make you some food to eat.” Zhao Shi went to the kitchen and bustled around.

            While she did, Zhao Feng kept on using his left eye to observe everything, and felt that his body had also gone through some changes. The most obvious change was his reaction speed.

            Hmmmmmmmm…

            While they were eating, Zhao Feng gaze landed upon a fly buzzing around.

            His left eye saw the fly’s flying route, he could even differentiate the gender, and he could also make out the veins upon its wings.

            Shoosh!

            He waved his chopsticks on instinct.

            Suddenly, the humming stopped.

            Hahaha! Zhao Feng looked at the fly killed by his chopsticks and laughed deep in his heart.

            This felt good!

            This felt damn nice!

            Because of his left eye, Zhao Feng’s reaction speed and sight now far surpassed those of normal people.

            After eating, Zhao Feng felt full of energy, so he raced towards the martial arts field. He had a feeling that the change in his left eye could possibly change his life…

            His left eye gave off sizzles of heat and after that, also gave off a peh-peh heartbeat sound.

            He didn’t know that as the mysterious eyeball merged with him, his bloodline and body were slowly changing.

            *********************************

            The Martial Arts Field

            Zhao Feng was the same as normal and started to practice his fist core martial arts.

            “Hahaha! Zhao Feng, you’re finally here, I thought you’d be a turtle hiding in your shell…,” came a laugh from the other side of the martial arts field.

            Damn it!, Zhao Feng swore in his heart and then looked at the muscular Zhao Kun, who was striding over. He then remembered the ‘one move battle’ with Zhao Kun.

            With Zhao Kun’s laugh, many sect disciples in the martial arts field came and gathered around.

            Looks like it cannot be avoided...

            Zhao Feng could only walk to meet him.</p>
