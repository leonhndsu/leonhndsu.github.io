        <p>Shin came out of Tsuki no Hokora and crossed the woods until he was in front of the ramparts and started to walk along it. Since he didn’t know which way the town entrance was, he went along with his feeling. He somehow knew that he would reach the town entrance sooner or later if he just walked while following the ramparts.

        “Anyway, these ramparts look really sturdy. “

        Shin thought as he saw the ramparts again. Because【Analyze】 was originally a skill to see the details of players and monsters, he didn’t know much about its magic bestowal beyond skill level Ⅴ. But from Tiera’s story, all skills were valuable and he could guess that there were excellent skill successors out there.

        After walking for around 15 minutes, he could see a line formed in front of the rampart. It seemed like there was a town gate nearby.

        And there were various people wearing all kinds of clothes. Furthermore, there was a human boy who wore tattered clothing, a female beast equipped with an armor and a dwarf who was accompanied by a small dragon. The person who wore a robe might be a magician, and the guy with a big wagon might be a merchant. Shin looked around while seeing the line moving slowly. Since all players in the game had a neat appearance (though there were some people who dressed in strange clothes), Shin was astonished by the scenery.

        A soldier who was equipped with an armor just like a townsguard, was checking something like an identification card. Besides that, they also checked the luggage in the wagon briefly. Shin walked straight to the gate since he had a letter of introduction from Tiera.

        About 20 mels from the gate, a guard noticed Shin who wasn’t waiting in line, and Shin had a suspicious look on his face.

        One of the guards approached Shin as he was about 10 mels from the gate.

        “Hey you! If you want to get into the town, get in the line! I can’t let you enter if you don’t line up.”

        Said the guard, while pointing at the end of the line. The line was so long that the end of the line couldn’t be seen.

        “Well, um, I was told I could enter the town if I show this.”

        He took out the letter of introduction from Item Box, while pretending to take it out from his chest pocket.

        The guard took the letter from Shin, looked at the contents, and revealed a shocked look. Not to mention, his hands were trembling afterward.

        “…Letter of introduction…from Tsuki no Hokora…”

        “Yes, I got it from the sales clerk.”

        Shin didn’t know why the guard was surprised, or what were the effects of a letter of introduction from Tsuki no Hokora.

        He was even worried about the guard whose hands were trembling.

        “I need to confirm whether this is the real thing. Come with me.”

        “Okay.”

        The guard gathered other guards and began to discuss something like ‘Is it genuine?’ Or ‘how do we decide whether it’s the real thing?’

        At the same time, Shin saw a horse that was 1.5 times bigger than a normal horse, stopped at the front gate.

        While Shin was looking at the horse, the guard returned.

        “I’m sorry to have kept you waiting. This way.”

        “Ah, I understand.”

        The guard’s manners changed completely and he became very polite. It was so sudden that it felt out of place.

        (Is the letter of introduction that great?)

        The road was opened for them while Shin felt stares from the people in the line. Besides that, the place was filled with people and several large wagons going in and out. Along the edge of the street, there were various stalls standing in a row, selling things like food, armor, accessories, strange items, and so on.</p>



        <p>“I will be your guide to the adventurers’ guild. Will that be all right for you?”

            “Huh? Oh, yes. Thank you very much.”

            Another guard talked to Shin. It seemed like he took over the task of the guard who spoke to Shin previously.

            “Do you have any plans to go somewhere else beside the guild? I’ll guide you if you don’t mind.”

            “No, because there is no other plan, I would like to head toward the adventurers’ guild, and please don’t use honorifics with me.”

            “Still…to be rude to those with a letter of introduction from Tsuki no Hokora.”

            “No problem, just act like usual.”

            “…Well, if you said so. I underst…”

            “Honorific!”

            “I understand, I understand, it’s just hard to adjust.” (T/N: The guard actually said “understand” in a polite tone. Then said it again in an informal tone.)

            Shin didn’t mean to act big just because he got the letter of introduction by chance. Meanwhile, the guard with the guide’s role, mixed up the formal and informal tone in his speech.

            “I’m glad you understand.”

            “Geez, for someone to have a letter of introduction and not wanting me to be polite?”

            “Well, it just felt wrong. By the way, I’m Shin. Nice to meet you.”

            Shin was formerly a student. He wasn’t accustomed by an older man using honorifics toward him.

            “I’m Beid. I’ve lived in this town my whole life. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.”

            Beid laughed after saying that. He gave an impression of a bear because of his brown hair and beard. According to 【Analyze • Ⅹ】, Beid was level 100. It was said that the strongest knight was level 158, so Shin couldn’t judge whether Beid was strong or not.

            “Then, I want to ask you something. Why was I being led to an adventurers’ guild?”

            Even though he intended to go to the adventurers’ guild, he didn’t remember saying it to the guard. But then he recalled where he had asked Tiera for any good places to gather information.

            “It was written in the introduction letter. I have to do it since it is stated in the letter of introduction from Tsuki no Hokora.”

            “I see. Ah, just to confirm, is the letter of introduction from Tsuki no Hokora such a big deal?”

            “Did you show it without knowing about it!?”

            For some reason he was surprised.

            “No, this is my first time coming to this country and it was a coincidence that I went to Tsuki no Hokora.”

            “Coincidence? And got a letter of introduction? You are something…”

            “I’m just a wanderer.”

            “Unbelievable! No, never mind then. I don’t know about other countries, but with the letter of introduction, it’s possible to have an audience with the King. Some people have even tried to forge the letter of introduction.”

            It seemed the letter of introduction was a rather big deal around here.

            “Tiera…this is more than an extra service…”

            Shin murmured as he regretted not knowing this awesome stuff earlier. Actually, he thought it was just a simple border pass. If Beid’s story was true, it was only natural that the guards were surprised.

            “I’d say, it would be a problem if it got lost…”

            “…Just now, someone passed it to the other guard.”

            Shin who just realized it, tried to get it back. But as Shin made a U-turn, he was stopped by Beid.

            “It’s okay, if it is the letter of introduction, I have it. How many guards can even carry it normally. It was returned before it could be left to idiots who are up to no good.”

            “Beid, good job!!”

            Shin unconsciously gave Beid a thumbs-up. Shin’s original image of him as a crude person was instantly erased, giving him a better impression of Beid.

            Shin then placed the letter of introduction in the 『Important Things』 zone in the Item Box. This zone had an anti-theft function attached . Skills like 【Steal】 or 【Robbery】 were not effective in this zone, so Shin didn’t have to worry about it getting stolen or robbed.

            “Oh, I almost forgot, when you arrive at the adventurers’ guild, give the letter of introduction to a receptionist named Els.”

            “Els?”

            “The miss receptionist of the guild, and at the same time, an elf adventurer. There are some kind of ancient elven runes written on that letter. And she is the only elf in the adventurers’ guild. So it is probably addressed to her.”

            “I understand. I’ll give it to her in the guild.”

            Shin didn’t know that Tiera had another elf as acquaintance, yet he firmly memorized her name.

            As the matter of the introduction letter was settled, Shin heard Beid’s explanation about the town.

            “That reminds me, this is your first time coming to this country. I will explain to you about this town. So first, this street is the rough division of the town. The gate you entered just now is the south gate. There are gates in the south, north, east and west, but only the south gate is used most often.”

            “Why is the south gate used mostly?”

            “The reason is that the south gate is the connecting point of the districts. There is also a commercial district in front of the south gate. Besides that, the king’s castle is in the center of this country, and the wealthy town residents, such as nobles and rich merchants, surround it. It is surrounded by the four districts.”

            “Hmm…I see…”</p>




        <p>“The south commercial district, as said just now, generally has everything you need like foods, items, miscellaneous goods and so forth. The guilds are in the east district. Many headquarters of guilds are located there, such as adventurers’ guild, merchants guild, blacksmiths guild and so on.

            The west is a residential district. Almost all of the town’s population live there. The inn is also a place for adventurers to replenish their stock from merchants, besides being the place to stay overnight. Finally, the north district…is in development for the time being.”

            Beid hesitated as he talked about the north district. Shin had an idea about it, so he asked Beid daringly.

            “Is the development only a name, or is it a slum area?”

            “As expected, you understand indeed. Yes, it is. Although I said it’s in a development zone, eventually those with no place to go started to move in one after another. Though each of them have their own motives. Anyway, its security is at the worst, and it’s better to stay away from there.”

            Beid advised Shin with a bitter expression.

            However, it was not only this country, but most big countries also have such places.

            Meanwhile, Shin observed the town situation as he listened to Beid. In the commercial district, various people were coming and going, Shin saw a man with an appearance of an adventurer. The man was carrying a large sword and wore a full body armor.

            Shin was excited and almost called out to him , especially after he saw the man was carrying a Dragon Sword. Beid said it was a weapon from an island country called ‘Hinomoto’, which is in the east of the continent.

            In the meantime, Shin arrived at the adventurers’ guild. The building was larger than the neighboring building, and had a signboard with a sword and a spear crossed were painted. Somehow, this was the representation of the adventurers’ guild.

            “My duty ends here. Don’t work yourself too hard in there.”

            “Oh, thank you for guiding me here, and for the information as well.”

            Shin went into the adventurers’ guild building after seeing off Beid who lightly waved his hand.

            He opened the guild’s door and entered.

            From the entrance door, the receptionist desk could be seen on the right side, and the bar on the left side. At the center hall, there was a bulletin board which had many requests posted on it.

            Since rowdy NPCs often hung around in adventurers’ guilds when he played the game, Shin had that image when entering the guild. Nevertheless, no garbage could be seen on the floor, nor adventurers shouting at each other, nor glares from other adventurers.

            It was merely a group of adventurers who had just finished their tasks and were having a toast. The bar seemed to be just a normal bar.

            Shin went straight toward the receptionist desk, even though he felt hungry after seeing the bar.

            “Welcome to the adventurers’ guild, how can I help you today?”

            The beautiful woman who was the receptionist greeted Shin as he approached. She had light brown hair that reached her shoulders. Apparently, the reception desk of guilds were always filled with beautiful women.

            There was also a tall man with a height of about 2 mels and scars on his face next to the receptionist. It goes without saying, Shin casually detoured to the woman’s side at the reception.

            “I would like to register as an adventurer.”

            “For that, please go upstairs on your left and head over to the second room. One J silver coin is required for the initial registration, is that alright with you?”

            “Yes, it’s alright. Thank you.”</p>

        <p>He voiced his gratitude and went up the stairs. Without stopping, Shin was thinking that there was no such procedure during the game. Then he saw the second room and entered it.

            Shin approached the desk on the middle, as there were only three desks.

            “We provide registration for adventurers here. You want to register as an adventurer, is that correct?”

            “Ah, yes, I want to register as an adventurer.”

            He replied to the receptionist with a bewildered look. Shin was confused, as the receptionist’s face and that of the receptionist below, were like two peas in a pod. The only difference was that this receptionist had her hair in a ponytail.

            “Is something the matter?”

            “No, you just look identical to the receptionist below.”

            “That is my older sister. Because we are twins, I am often mistaken as her. I will be helping you register today. My name is Cilica Lindt. Please treat me well.”

            “I am Shin. Please take care of me as well.”

            “First, you will need to pay the initial cost of one J silver coin.”

            “Okay.”

            He took out one J silver coin from Item Box. Shin thought it looked a little unnatural since he took it out from his chest, but Cilica received the coin without any suspicion.

            “Then, please fill out this form.”

            In the document, there were entries to be filled up such as name, race, main weapon, able to use magic or not, and so on.

            “Do I have to fill out everything?”

            “No, only your name and race are required. While it would be easier to receive support if you fill it all out, we won’t force you as this is not compulsory. No one will treat you differently because of it. So please rest assured.”

            “Okay.”

            Since there was an entry for place of birth, Shin just had to skip it, because he was not from this world. The race was filled as a human just in case.

            Main weapon was sword, able to use magic, and because there was entry for age, one year of the death game was added in his true age, so he wrote down as 21 years old.</p>

        <p>It was a bit late to bring it up now, but the document was written in Japanese. The spoken language was Japanese, so it was only natural that it was also being used in the document. Shin was thankful because of it. He was worried in the beginning, as he thought it would be written with characters like wriggling earthworms.

            After that, he gave the document to Cilica, and she just skimmed it through. She was probably checking if it was incomplete.

            “Your name is Shin-sama, is that right?”

            “Yes. That’s right.”

            “Then the document is complete. Next, please drip one drop of blood on this card.

            Cilica handed Shin a needle and a silver card.

            Shin pricked the tip of his finger and dripped the blood on the card. The card didn’t reject the blood and absorbed it like a sponge.

            “With this, the procedure is complete. The card will take one day to process, so it will be ready by tomorrow.”

            “Okay.”

            It seemed that he would need to wait until tomorrow before receiving his card.

            “Would you like hear more information about the guild?”

            “Yes, please.”

            “First of all, adventurers are divided by ranks, from the highest SS to S, A, B, C, D, E, F, and the lowest G rank. Because Shin-sama just registered, your rank is G. Whenever a request is completed, the point is added and your rank will rise accordingly. If a request is failed or abandoned, the point for the request is subtracted from the current point. The rank will drop if the points are below a certain standard. In addition, you must pay the cancellation fee twice of the reward offered. You can receive requests up to two ranks above you. You can only receive requests one rank above you if you become rank C and above. You can form a party with two or more members. It is also possible to participate in the request of the top three or more rank. Depending on the members, you will receive the request according to the members of the top rank.”

            “What is the maximum number of members allowed in a party?”

            Shin asked since he was interested. The maximum number of people in a party was six people during the game.

            “One party can be formed by up to six members. It becomes a form called joint work, where you cross multiple parties when you receive a request for further numbers of people. This is usually seen on subjugation requests of strong monsters, or fairly large-scale requests.”

            It seemed that the number of party members remained unchanged. However, the request (it was called Quest in the game) for further numbers of people seemed different from the game, there was no joint work or multiple parties.

            “There are various kinds of requests such as miscellaneous duties, fishing, subjugation, escort, and so forth. Please be warned that the guild won’t take responsibility for taking a request without the guild’s approval. An unsuitable request for your ability is likely to receive or sustain severe injuries or even death.”</p>
