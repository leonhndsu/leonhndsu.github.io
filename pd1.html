Design Pattern #1 

Pattern: Pyramid

What – Link together ordered pages with back/next links. You want to have a parent page that links to all of the pages in the sequence. Users can go through the pages sequentially or any order. 
When – This usually occur when you are reading an online book or a picture slideshow, anything that involves a sequence of something.
Why – To reduce number of clicks and to improve navigation. 
How – List all the pages in order on the parent page. Each of the pages linked in the parent page will have a back/next link and each of those links are in sequential order.
