<p>Design Pattern #1</p> 

<br><br>

<p>Pattern: Pyramid</p>

<p>What – Link together ordered pages with back/next links. You want to have a parent page that links to all of the pages in the sequence. Users can go through the pages sequentially or any order. </p>
<p>When – This usually occur when you are reading an online book or a picture slideshow, anything that involves a sequence of something. </p>
<p>Why – To reduce number of clicks and to improve navigation. </p>
<p>How – List all the pages in order on the parent page. Each of the pages linked in the parent page will have a back/next link and each of those links are in sequential order. </p>
