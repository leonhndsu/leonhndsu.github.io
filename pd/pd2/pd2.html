<p>Design Pattern #2</p> 

<br><br>

<p>Pattern: Ch.4: Collapsible Panels</p>

<p>What – Add an optional panel that can be toggle on and off. Such as a menu. </p>
<p>When – This can be used when the layout needs a button, menu, extra module, or something that can enhance the user experience. </p>
<p>Why – It helps simplify the interface and greatly make the user’s experience better. </p>
<p>How – You would have a clickable button that toggle on/off for the panel. The button would have an icon that shows that it is toggle on or off. </p>
