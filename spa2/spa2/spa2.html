<p>Special Topic Assignment #2</p>

<p>TOPIC: Material Design Lite</p>

The Topic I’ve been researching is Material Design Lite.  Material Design Lite Is best describe as, “doesn’t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers, and offer an experience that is immediately accessible.”  It is typically used as marketing pages, articles, blogs and general web content.</p>

<p>Here an example of how MDL is applied on a website.</p>

<a href="https://leonhndsu.github.io/spa2/spa2/index.html">https://leonhndsu.github.io/spa2/spa2/index.html</a></p>

<p>Example:  Hero Academia Website</p>

<p>This website template can be found at <a href="https://getmdl.io/templates/index.html">https://getmdl.io/templates/index.html.</a> </p>

<p>Material Design Lite helps create CSS a lot simpler once understanding the documentation of MDL. For the first example: Android Website, instead of writing ‘text-transform: uppercase’ you can mdl-typography--text-uppercase to make the text all in caps. MDL also have their own class-icons and built-in animation effects. It is useful if you don’t want to use other sources. When using MDL, you must make sure the classes are MDL components, so it can be used in the MDL library. Such examples: mdl-layout__drawer, mdl-navigation, mdl-layout-title, and much more. </p>

<p>What is unique about MDL is that it has a close collaboration with the Chrome UX team. They would regularly review and make sure everything is up to date. UX and MDL have great synergy due to its active community and compatibility to most browsers. </p>

<p>I think essentially, MDL is best used for creating centered-style layout and small components that can increase the appeal of a website. For example, on this page: <a href="https://getmdl.io/components/index.html">https://getmdl.io/components/index.html</a> , MDL has many cool components that can enhance the website. You can have different type of buttons, a table-like format, sliders, toggles, and evening a loading component! </p>

<p>Material Design Lite have a great potential library that can be helpful for people who aren’t into using many other libraries for creating websites. It is CSS-oriented and not much for Javascript and Jquery. MDL also works on other platforms, which increase the appeal for MDL.</p>

<p>The one thing I do have a problem with MDL is the color customization option. They don’t have all the colors into one package but individual package. At times, it gets kind of annoying because not all the colors are there. I also think some of their explanation on using their library is kind of strange and documentation you need to go the Github page or other websites such as <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/materialdesignlite/index.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/materialdesignlite/index.htm</a> to understand the MDL library.</p>

<p>Overall, Material Design Lite is a very nice library but will be hard to get used to. But once you learn the MDL library, it is fun and accessible.</p>
